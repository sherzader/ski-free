## About Game

My implementation of the classic Microsoft [game]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkiFree by Chris Pirih. Written in pure, vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Features
* Game begins upon triggering of keydown handler
* Arrow key listeners allow for multiple trajectories
* Original design for moving background objects relative to skier object based on keycode
* Collision detection
* Three skier sprites for player's different velocities and one for collision
* Game Over screen reloads new game

ToDo
- [ ] Create Rails back end for Leaderboard
- [ ] Implement speed difficulty options for player
- [ ] Add more obstacles, like rocks, and of course, the Yeti
