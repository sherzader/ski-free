## About Game

My implementation of the classic [Microsoft game][wiki] by Chris Pirih. Written in vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Features

- Game begins upon triggering of keydown handler
- Secret skiing pizza move, figure out which key press triggers it!
- Original design for moving background objects relative to skier object based on keycode
- Collision detection
- Yeti will eat you, you being the skier. Sorry, it is what it is.

ToDo

- [ ] Smoothen Yeti's motion as it chases poor Skier
- [ ] Create back end for Leaderboard
- [ ] Implement speed difficulty options for player
